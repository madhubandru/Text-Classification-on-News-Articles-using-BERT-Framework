### Files included

As implemented three different succesful approaches for text classification, we have maintained a single notebook for each approach. In approach experimented is not successfully completed so, we dint include the notebook for same.

1.	Baseline Model – Simple Sequential Neural Network.
2.	BERT Model with Keras Embeddings.
3.	BERT model using BERT’s default embedding technique.
4.	BERT model using embeddings from ELMo.
